## Data source
 For the model training, 80K+ different fashion item images from [DeepFashion](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html) & [DeepFashion2](https://github.com/switchablenorms/DeepFashion2).
 
 For the recommendation catalog, 3K+ images are scraped from 5 ethical brands, which are rated as 'good'/'great' in a sustainability rating site '[Good On You](https://goodonyou.eco/)'. The 5 brands are:

 [<img src='images/everlane.jpg' height=25>](https://www.everlane.com/)<br>
 [<img src='images/patagonia.jpg' height=28>](https://www.patagonia.com/home/)<br>

## How does it work??
 **Step 1: Uploading an image with fashion items**  
 <img src='images/step1.png' height=250>
 
 **Step 2: View the 5 closest alternative recommendation**

 **Step 3: Click the link to view product details or make a purchase on the ethical fashion site**

## Working principle
 - 3 models were trained separately to classify **categories(13)**, **colors(10)**, and **attributes(8)** of the input image and scraped images. 
 - Each image will be turned into a 31-feature array
 - Similarity was calculated using dot product
 - Finally our recommender yields 5 most similar fashion items.

## Classification models
**1. Category**
- Using Detectron2 library
- Architecture of Faster R-CNN
- Accuracy up to 68%

**2. Color**
- Using Keras library
- Architecture referencing to a [research paper from the team of Reza Fuad Rachmadi](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.07391.pdf)
- Accuracy up to 70%

**3. Attribute**
- Using Keras library
- Transfering learning from VGG16
- Accuracy up to 52%


## Deployment
 The 3 models are deployed in local machine using Streamlit.


## Challenges
- Lack of real time recommended product data from the ethical brands
  - Solution: Use API as data source (if presence), scrape the product frequently
- Subjectivity in color labelling


## Skills Acquired
- Web scraping
- Computer vision
- Content-based recommendation system
- Model deployment
